    "The Data file USData contains a number of variables from the 50 states in the United States. In this exercise we are interested in using linear regression to predict _violrate_, the rate of violent crimes such as murder, robbery, and assault per 100,000 population in 1995. We shall use the following independent variables: _unemprat_ (average monthly unemployment rate in 1995), _density_ (population density in 1995), and _gsprod_ (gross state product in 1995 -- a measure of the state's economic productivity). Estimate two linear regression models using MLE. The first model is the null model, while the second includes the three independent variables. Use the output from these models to compute the following fit statistics from the second model: McFadden adjusted $R^2$ and the pseudo-$R^2$. Then compute the AIC and BIC from both models."
